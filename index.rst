   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. _I:

This page introducess the :term:`RobotML` platform (see section below)
as well as the the way to build the documentation you are reading (see :ref:`DHT`).
There is, following, a section dedicated to indices and tables (see :ref:`IT`)
and finally a list of websites linked to the platform (see :ref:`LW`).

RobotML Documentation
=====================

RobotML is a language associated to a platform linked to PAPYRUS tool and build
upon ECLIPSE framework. The goal of this language is to ease development of
robotics application and to facilitate exchanges between roboticians and
end-users. 

:term:`RobotML` documentation is decomposed in many parts. 
A presentation of its rationale is done in its introduction, 
then, instructions are provided in order to install the platform
followed by some hints of how to use it through some examples.
The following sections are providing in-depth information on the underlying language
(the so-called meta-model), the different choices done in order to present the user modelling capabilities
and finally the different generators add-ons with example of use.
The last section is dedicated to the web :term:`portal`
and its interactions with the :term:`RobotML` platform.

The last bit of important information is that each time it is necessary,
the documentation will separate the :term:`user` point of view from the :term:`developper` one
trying to limit the amount of knowledge to what is strictly deemed necessary.

More information on RobotML are available through its

.. warning::
   Documentation is written solely in English due to lack of resources that would have allowed at least a French version. The reason for this choice is the importance of dissemination and cooperation at the European Level (see projects such as :term:`BRICS`\ ).
