RobotML-documentation
=====================

The *RobotML* tool is constituded of many parts that ask for a lot of documentation. This github project allows the developer to manage the different issues linked to this documentation. Hereafter a description follows of these different issues.

  1. the complete documentation of the project available in the repository associated with this github project and using the reStructuredText markup language. Sphinx documentation generator (see http://sphinx-doc.org/) is used that allows to generate towards different types of target such as html, pdf, oasis, ...;
  2. the cheat sheets associated with the modeling tool (a specific eclipse project allows to manage the cheat sheets development). These cheat sheets are versioned under the eclipse repository due to the RobotML status of PAPYRUS extra feature;
  3. the documentation present on the RIM portal (see http://europe.bourges.univ-orleans.fr/). This portal embodies the life cycle of RobotML development;
  4. Due to its origin in the scope of the French ANR project PROTEUS (see http://www.anr-proteus.fr/), there is remaining documentation that should stay tuned to the actual and main documentation development tree.

The online html documentation (see point 1) is available following http://robotml.github.com/.
