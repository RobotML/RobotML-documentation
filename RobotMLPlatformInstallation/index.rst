RobotML Platform Installation
=============================

There is a need to differentiate the needs of the :term:`user` and those arising from the development. These
sections follow this differentiation. The :term:`user` needs the easiest installation possible in order to obey the
philosophy of the platform, *ease development of robotic applications*. The :term:`developper` is needing the most
complete installation and thus needs a lot more information.
