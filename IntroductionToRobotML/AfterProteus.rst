After PROTEUS
-------------

**PROTEUS** was just a project. Its results (Modelling platform, Generation
tooling, convergence towards :term:`ROS` exchanges,
:term:`open access to Robotic platforms <OARP>` for outsiders, etc) are to
exist after its end because of their use. The
:term:`Robotic modelling language <RobotML>` is not dependant of the project,
the :term:`OARP`\ s are for two of them to go on living their life, the
Community :term:`portal` will be maintained and updated during two years and so
on and so forth. It is of the utmost importance to understand that the project
was a service to the French Robotic community in order to allow increase of
exchange and to open market to innovative product shortening time between
research centres and industry.
